## Click 'Agree' to Access: A workshop on data privacy and browser extensions * By [Qianxun Chen](chenqianxun.com)

## Introduction & Essential Question
- What are we actually agreeing to when we click "I Agree" to Terms of services and privacy policies? In this workshop we will be using browsers and browser extensions to take a closer look at the digital services we use everyday. We are going to learn more about digital privacies by studying some terms of services in small groups. What kinds of data are constantly collected from us and how are the companies going to use them to make profit? How can we protect our data by changing browser/account settings or using privacy tools?

- In the second half of the workshop we will see examples of browser extensions created by artists and programmers to challenge, disrupt and fight back to online data surveillance, followed by a basic introduction to making browser extensions. How might we use browser extensions as tools for hacktivism and to express ourselves creatively?

### Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
Some basic understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is preferred but not a must.
For the workshop we are going to use the chrome browser and [Atom code editor](https://atom.io/).

### Outcomes & Goals
After this workshop, students will walk away with:
- What kinds of data are collected by websites/services and how are they collected
- How to change user settings in web browsers and user accounts to protect their data

## Before Class
* Make sure you have chrome browser installed and Atom code editor.
* Read [7 Sketchy Terms and Conditions You Didn't Read (but Probably Should)](https://www.thrillist.com/tech/nation/terms-and-conditions-youve-mindlessly-agreed-to-fine-print-in-end-user-license-agreements)

## Exercise Descriptions
### I.Understanding Terms of Service
- Step 1: Make a list of ten digital tools you've used most in the last two months.
  - What app/web service do you use to communicate with your family or your friends? To search information or ask questions? To have fun and spend your free time?
- Step 2: Before we have access to these services, we always need to check "I Agree" to terms of service that no one reads. Now let’s learn more about these terms together with the help from a browser extension.
  - Install the browser extension [tosDR](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terms-of-service-didn%E2%80%99t-r/hjdoplcnndgiblooccencgcggcoihigg?hl=en) in your browser and check [their website](https://edit.tosdr.org/)
  - Work in a group of 3-4 and choose a website/service you want to work on together
    - What data does this service collect from you?
    - How is the company going to use these data?
    - Does what you read from tosDR matches your current understanding of the web service? Is there anything that surprises you?
    - If you found any terms that you don’t understand, refer to the vocabulary list, find more about it online or ask the instructor for help.
  - We are going to fill in a google doc together so everyone can refer to it later after class.
- Step 3: Share what you learnt about the service with the class.
- Step 4: Strategies: How can we better protect ourselves?
